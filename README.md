JavaScript Object Notation (JSON, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪˌsɒn/[note 1]) is an open-standard file format or data interchange format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as replacement for XML in AJAX systems.[7]

JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. JSON filenames use the extension .json.

Douglas Crockford originally specified the JSON format in the early 2000s. JSON was first standardized in 2013, as ECMA-404.[8] The latest JSON format standard was published in 2017 as RFC 8259, and remains consistent with ECMA-404.[9] That same year, JSON was also standardized as ISO/IEC 21778:2017.[1] The ECMA and ISO standards describe only the allowed syntax, whereas the RFC covers some security and interoperability considerations.[10]
